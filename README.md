# Zummoner: The Zsh Spellbook


## Invoke the Power of the Command Line with a Whisper

Are you a seasoned sorcerer of the shell, or a fledgling apprentice seeking to master the arcane arts of Linux?  Do you find yourself weary of reciting lengthy incantations (commands) for even the simplest of tasks?  Then *Zummoner* is the grimoire you've been waiting for.

Zummoner is a Zsh plugin that allows you to *summon* the correct command for your task with a mere phrase.  Describe what you wish to accomplish, and Zummoner will consult its ancient knowledge (a Large Language Model) to conjure the precise spell (command) needed.

## Features - The Enchantments Within

* **Command Conjuration:**  Simply type your desired task in natural language, and Zummoner will generate the corresponding command.
* **System Awareness:** Zummoner understands the nature of your realm (system) by querying `uname -a` and adapts its spells accordingly. It also knows who *you* are, the current user.
* **Modern Arcana:**  Zummoner favors the latest and most potent spells â€“ `homectl` over `adduser`, `ip` over `ifconfig`, `systemctl` and `journalctl` for system management.
* **Safety First:**  The spells Zummoner casts are carefully vetted to avoid unintended consequences. It prioritizes safe and reliable commands.
* **Adaptable to Your Lore:** Zummoner can be configured to use your preferred LLM model.
* **Seamless Integration:** Zummoner integrates directly into your Zsh shell, becoming a natural extension of your command-line mastery.

## Installation - Binding the Spirit to Your Shell

To bind the spirit of Zummoner to your Zsh shell, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  Venture into the digital ether and retrieve the Zummoner grimoire from its repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/day50-dev/zummoner.git ~/.zsh/plugins/zummoner
   ```

2. **Activate the Plugin:**  Open your `.zshrc` file and add `zummoner` to the `plugins` array:

   ```zsh
   plugins=(... zummoner)
   ```

3. **Recharge Your Shell:**  Refresh your Zsh shell to imbue it with Zummoner's power:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. **Bind the Key:** Zummoner is bound to `^Xx` (Ctrl+x, then x) by default. If this keybinding is already in use, you will need to rebind it manually.  The plugin will warn you if this is the case.

## Usage - Uttering the Incantation

1.  Press `^Xx` (Ctrl+x, then x). This will open Zummoner, awaiting your command.
2.  Type a description of the task you wish to perform. For example: "list all files in the current directory sorted by size".
3.  Zummoner will consult its knowledge and present you with the corresponding command.
4.  Press Enter to execute the command.

## Configuration - Customizing the Ritual

* **LLM Model:**  By default, Zummoner will attempt to use a default LLM model. You can specify a different model by creating a file named `default_model.txt` in the `~/.config/io.datasette.llm/` directory and placing the model name within it.  Ensure the directory exists.

## Caveats - The Limits of Magic

* **LLM Dependency:** Zummoner relies on a Large Language Model to function.  Ensure you have a compatible LLM setup and access.
* **Network Connection:**  An active network connection is required to communicate with the LLM.
* **Command Safety:** While Zummoner strives to generate safe commands, always review the generated command before execution, especially if it involves `sudo`.  Magic can be unpredictable!
* **System Compatibility:**  Zummoner attempts to generate commands compatible with your system, but variations in Linux distributions may require adjustments.
